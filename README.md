# Resampling
The final project for the University of Waterloo course STAT854, which I completed during the Winter 2020 semester. Consists in a simulation study comparing three methods for population mean estimation for stratified sampling: Jones' jackknife, Rao & Wu's bootstrap, and Sitter's mirror-match.
